# __Word Nerds__

### by [James Benjamin Pawlik](http://github.com/jbpawlik)

### __Description__
Word Nerds is a site that allows students to submit their own definitions for words. The definitions are collected on the word's page and may be updated, added to, or deleted.


### __Technologies Used__
Word Nerds was written in Ruby. Routing was handled by Sinatra. Debugging was handled by the Pry gem. Testing was done with the RSpec, Capybara, and simplecov gems. A custom Ruby script created the project directory and files. Page content is written as embedded Ruby/HTML, with styling from CSS.
